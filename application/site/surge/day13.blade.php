                                                                            Like Thomas we didn’t know the way.  He is the way to the Father, to forgiveness, to salvation, life eternal and life here more abundantly and to truth.
                                                                        </p>

Father, Son and Holy Spirit three in one. As stated in day one we must know Him, His character as that is where our faith begins and ends.  When we have a balanced understanding of who God is, and of His character our trust in Him will flow naturally.
                                                                        </p>

You saw our substance before we were formed in our mother’s womb.  Your word tells us that all our days were planned out and recorded before we were born.  You have a purpose and a plan for each of us, to prosper us and not harm us.  May we be opened to Your truth that You have already planned for us, and receive it, glorifying and honoring You. Let us ask this in the name of Jesus, Your Son.
