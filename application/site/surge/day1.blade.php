Her instruction came from Adam.  She didn’t know the name of the tree as she referred to it as the tree in the midst of the garden. Also adding to God’s command by saying “nor shall you touch it”.

Satan went after her because she was the weaker vessel...God gave the command to Adam not her.  And Adam ate possibly because of his love (Idolatry) of Eve.  He put her before God .  They both walked, talked, ate and had fellowship with God regularly.  All dissolved because they let go of their perspective .

Woman now would have to fight the desire to rule their husband.  And their husband rule them.  Sin has corrupted the peaceful workings in the relationship between man and women .  Willing submission by the wife and loving headship by the husband now deeply flawed.  This list goes on...all because of accepting a wrong perspective of God.

These devotions are merely an appetizer to bring us to search the yet deeper truths of who God is on our own.
