There are those times in our lives when we get a good doctor report when the out come could have been so different.  Those times when financially we are blessed when not expecting it and in great need.  When we have been traveling and we were detoured and find out later there was a traffic jam that would have held us up for hours.  We say <b>GOD IS GOOD!</b>

One by one congregants got up to give God glory for all He had done in each life.  Aunt Edna’s test for diabetes came back negative; Brother Joe had sliced his finger on a small saw while cutting branches, the doctors didn’t expect him to be able to move it, but he could.  On and on the testimonies were shared and the congregation was praising the Lord.  There was a woman in her early fifties sitting in the back of the church who had just been diagnosed with stage four colon cancer.  She looked so sad.  Another women at the front of the church noticed the sadness and was reminded by the Lord that we are to rejoice in all circumstances.  So she bravely stood and gave testimony that she had been breast cancer free for ten years, and two days ago she visited her doctor who told her she now had ovarian cancer and declared God’s praises.  The congregation was quiet and subdued. The woman with terminal colon cancer looked surprised and also at peace.  As the two visited later in the week she explained her sadness listening to all the reports and wondered why God had not been there for her also.  The two visited weekly encouraging each other and sharing their experiences with the Lord on his closeness and compassion, and fear left as they were engulfed in His love.
                                                                        </p>
                                                                        <p><br></p>
                                                                        <p class="moto-text_system_10">One woman stepped over into eternity the other didn’t and both experienced the goodness of the Lord. I dare say that the goodness of God has absolutely nothing to do with what He does for us, more so His goodness is because of WHO He is.
                                                                        </p>

                                                                        <p class="moto-text_system_10">Is He not good to those who get a doctor report that is terminal, or is He not still good if the check that is desperately needed doesn’t come?  Was He not good to those stuck in the traffic jam?  Of course God is good...all the time.  We aren’t used to giving Him praise in the onset of our trial.
                                                                        </p>
                                                                        <p><br></p>
                                                                        <p class="moto-text_system_10">His goodness is shown in the middle of the storms of life. His presence is being experienced no matter how the winds blow, and the pain feels as though life is crumbling beneath us. He magnifies Himself and comforts, He is right there ever present in the darkness with us. He is gracious and full of compassion, His tender mercies are over all His works. This is a special place to walk with God and we should not fear our trials or struggles but allow His will be done. His will is perfect.
